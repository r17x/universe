## Features

- **Interactive Chat**: A conversational AI agent that understands your requests and breaks down complex tasks.
- **Powerful Toolset**: A suite of tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution, right from the chat prompt.
  - Read, write, and patch files (`read_file`, `write_file`, `search_replace`).
  - Execute shell commands in a stateful terminal (`bash`).
  - Recursively search code with `grep` (with `ripgrep` support).
  - Manage a `todo` list to track the agent's work.
  - Ask interactive questions to gather user input (`ask_user_question`).
  - Delegate tasks to subagents for parallel work (`task`).
- **Project-Aware Context**: Vibe automatically scans your project's file structure and Git status to provide relevant context to the agent, improving its understanding of your codebase.
- **Advanced CLI Experience**: Built with modern libraries for a smooth and efficient workflow.
  - Autocompletion for slash commands (`/`) and file paths (`@`).
  - Persistent command history.
  - Beautiful Themes.
- **Highly Configurable**: Customize models, providers, tool permissions, and UI preferences through a simple `config.toml` file.
- **Safety First**: Features tool execution approval.
- **Multiple Built-in Agents**: Choose from different agent profiles tailored for specific workflows.

### Built-in Agents

Vibe comes with several built-in agent profiles, each designed for different use cases:

- **`default`**: Standard agent that requires approval for tool executions. Best for general use.
- **`plan`**: Read-only agent for exploration and planning. Auto-approves safe tools like `grep` and `read_file`.
- **`accept-edits`**: Auto-approves file edits only (`write_file`, `search_replace`). Useful for code refactoring.
- **`auto-approve`**: Auto-approves all tool executions. Use with caution.

Use the `--agent` flag to select a different agent:

```bash
vibe --agent plan
```

To change the default agent used when `--agent` is not passed, set
`default_agent` in your `config.toml`:

```toml
default_agent = "plan"
```

Valid values are `default`, `plan`, `accept-edits`, `auto-approve`,
`lean` (only when listed in `installed_agents`), or the name of any
custom agent file in `~/.vibe/agents/` or the project's `.vibe/agents/`
directory. Subagents such as `explore` are not accepted.

> Note: `default_agent` only applies to interactive sessions. In
> programmatic mode (`-p` / `--prompt`), Vibe falls back to `auto-approve`
> when `--agent` is not provided, so `default_agent` is ignored.

### Subagents and Task Delegation

Vibe supports subagents for delegating tasks. Subagents run independently and can perform specialized work without user interaction, preventing the context from being overloaded.

The `task` tool allows the agent to delegate work to subagents:

```
> Can you explore the codebase structure while I work on something else?

🤖 I'll use the task tool to delegate this to the explore subagent.

> task(task="Analyze the project structure and architecture", agent="explore")
```

Create custom subagents by adding `agent_type = "subagent"` to your agent configuration. Vibe comes with a built-in subagent called `explore`, a read-only subagent for codebase exploration used internally for delegation.

### Interactive User Questions

The `ask_user_question` tool allows the agent to ask you clarifying questions during its work. This enables more interactive and collaborative workflows.

```
> Can you help me refactor this function?

🤖 I need to understand your requirements better before proceeding.

> ask_user_question(questions=[{
    "question": "What's the main goal of this refactoring?",
    "options": [
        {"label": "Performance", "description": "Make it run faster"},
        {"label": "Readability", "description": "Make it easier to understand"},
        {"label": "Maintainability", "description": "Make it easier to modify"}
    ]
}])
```

The agent can ask multiple questions at once, displayed as tabs. Each question supports 2-4 options plus an automatic "Other" option for free text responses.

## Terminal Requirements

Vibe's interactive interface requires a modern terminal emulator. Recommended terminal emulators include:

- **WezTerm** (cross-platform)
- **Alacritty** (cross-platform)
- **Ghostty** (Linux and macOS)
- **Kitty** (Linux and macOS)

Most modern terminals should work, but older or minimal terminal emulators may have display issues.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to your project's root directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Run Vibe:

   ```bash
   vibe
   ```

3. If this is your first time running Vibe, it will:
   - Create a default configuration file at `~/.vibe/config.toml`
   - Prompt you to enter your API key if it's not already configured
   - Save your API key to `~/.vibe/.env` for future use

   Alternatively, you can configure your API key separately using `vibe --setup`.

4. Start interacting with the agent!

   ```
   > Can you find all instances of the word "TODO" in the project?

   🤖 The user wants to find all instances of "TODO". The `grep` tool is perfect for this. I will use it to search the current directory.

   > grep(pattern="TODO", path=".")

   ... (grep tool output) ...

   🤖 I found the following "TODO" comments in your project.
   ```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Simply run `vibe` to enter the interactive chat loop.

- **Multi-line Input**: Press `Ctrl+J` or `Shift+Enter` for select terminals to insert a newline.
- **File Paths**: Reference files in your prompt using the `@` symbol for smart autocompletion (e.g., `> Read the file @src/agent.py`).
- **Shell Commands**: Prefix any command with `!` to execute it directly in your shell, bypassing the agent (e.g., `> !ls -l`).
- **External Editor**: Press `Ctrl+G` to edit your current input in an external editor.
- **Tool Output Toggle**: Press `Ctrl+O` to toggle the tool output view.
- **Todo View Toggle**: Press `Ctrl+T` to toggle the todo list view.
- **Debug Console**: Press `Ctrl+\` to toggle the debug console.
- **Agent Selection**: Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle through agents (default, plan, ...).

You can start Vibe with a prompt using the following command:

```bash
vibe "Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular."
```

### Trust Folder System

Vibe includes a trust folder system to ensure you only run the agent in directories you trust. When you first run Vibe in a new directory which contains a `.vibe` subfolder, it may ask you to confirm whether you trust the folder.

Trusted folders are remembered for future sessions. You can manage trusted folders through its configuration file `~/.vibe/trusted_folders.toml`.

This safety feature helps prevent accidental execution in sensitive directories.

### Programmatic Mode

You can run Vibe non-interactively by piping input or using the `--prompt` flag. This is useful for scripting.

```bash
vibe --prompt "Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular."
```

By default, it uses `auto-approve` mode.

#### Programmatic Mode Options

When using `--prompt`, you can specify additional options:

- **`--max-turns N`**: Limit the maximum number of assistant turns. The session will stop after N turns.
- **`--max-price DOLLARS`**: Set a maximum cost limit in dollars. The session will be interrupted if the cost exceeds this limit.
- **`--max-tokens N`**: Set a maximum cumulative LLM token budget for the session, counting both prompt and completion tokens. The session will be interrupted if usage exceeds this limit.
- **`--enabled-tools TOOL`**: Enable specific tools. In programmatic mode, this disables all other tools. Can be specified multiple times. Supports exact names, glob patterns (e.g., `bash*`), or regex with `re:` prefix (e.g., `re:^serena_.*$`).
- **`--output FORMAT`**: Set the output format. Options:
  - `text` (default): Human-readable text output
  - `json`: All messages as JSON at the end
  - `streaming`: Newline-delimited JSON per message

Example:

```bash
vibe --prompt "Analyze the codebase" --max-turns 5 --max-price 1.0 --max-tokens 50000 --output json
```

## Voice Mode

> [!WARNING]
> Voice mode is experimental and may change in future releases.

Voice mode allows you to dictate input using your microphone instead of typing.

### Activating Voice Mode

Toggle voice mode on or off with the `/voice` slash command:

```
> /voice
```

### Recording Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action           |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| `Ctrl+R` | Start recording  |
| Any key  | Stop recording   |
| `Escape` | Cancel recording |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel recording |

## Slash Commands

Use slash commands for meta-actions and configuration changes during a session.

### Built-in Slash Commands

Vibe provides several built-in slash commands. Use slash commands by typing them in the input box:

```
> /help
```

### Custom Slash Commands via Skills

You can define your own slash commands through the skills system. Skills are reusable components that extend Vibe's functionality.

To create a custom slash command:

1. Create a skill directory with a `SKILL.md` file
2. Set `user-invocable = true` in the skill metadata
3. Define the command logic in your skill

Example skill metadata:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: My custom skill with slash commands
user-invocable: true
---
```

Custom slash commands appear in the autocompletion menu alongside built-in commands.

## Skills System

Vibe's skills system allows you to extend functionality through reusable components. Skills can add new tools, slash commands, and specialized behaviors.

Vibe follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) for skill format and structure.

### Creating Skills

Skills are defined in directories with a `SKILL.md` file containing metadata in YAML frontmatter. For example, `~/.vibe/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Perform automated code reviews
license: MIT
compatibility: Python 3.12+
user-invocable: true
allowed-tools:
  - read_file
  - grep
  - ask_user_question
---

# Code Review Skill

This skill helps analyze code quality and suggest improvements.
```

### Skill Discovery

Vibe discovers skills from multiple locations:

1. **Custom paths**: Configured in `config.toml` via `skill_paths`
2. **Standard Agent Skills path** (project root, trusted folders only): `.agents/skills/` — [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard
3. **Local project skills** (project root, trusted folders only): `.vibe/skills/` in your project
4. **Global skills directories**: `~/.vibe/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/`

```toml
skill_paths = ["/path/to/custom/skills"]
```

### Managing Skills

Enable or disable skills using patterns in your configuration:

```toml
# Enable specific skills
enabled_skills = ["code-review", "test-*"]

# Disable specific skills
disabled_skills = ["experimental-*"]
```

Skills support the same pattern matching as tools (exact names, glob patterns, and regex).

## Configuration

### Configuration File Location

Vibe is configured via a `config.toml` file. It looks for this file first in `./.vibe/config.toml` and then falls back to `~/.vibe/config.toml`.

### API Key Configuration

To use Vibe, you'll need a Mistral API key. You can obtain one by signing up at [https://console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai).

You can configure your API key using `vibe --setup`, or through one of the methods below.

Vibe supports multiple ways to configure your API keys:

1. **Interactive Setup (Recommended for first-time users)**: When you run Vibe for the first time or if your API key is missing, Vibe will prompt you to enter it. The key will be securely saved to `~/.vibe/.env` for future sessions.

2. **Environment Variables**: Set your API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export MISTRAL_API_KEY="your_mistral_api_key"
   ```

3. **`.env` File**: Create a `.env` file in `~/.vibe/` and add your API keys:

   ```bash
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
   ```

   Vibe automatically loads API keys from `~/.vibe/.env` on startup. Environment variables take precedence over the `.env` file if both are set.

**Note**: The `.env` file is specifically for API keys and other provider credentials. General Vibe configuration should be done in `config.toml`.

### TLS and Corporate Certificate Authorities

By default, Vibe uses the bundled `certifi` certificate roots for outbound HTTPS requests. If your organization installs private certificate authorities in the operating system trust store, you can opt in to the system trust store in `config.toml`:

```toml
enable_system_trust_store = true
```

`SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` are still supported and are loaded as additional trust anchors.

### Custom System Prompts

You can create `AGENTS.md` files to add custom instructions. You can also replace the entire system prompt.

Place `AGENTS.md` files in:
- `~/.vibe/AGENTS.md` — user-level instructions for all projects
- Project directories — project-specific instructions, loaded from cwd up to the trust root

Priority: closer directories override more distant ones. Instructions in `AGENTS.md` override the default system prompt. Files are only loaded for trusted folders.

Custom system prompts entirely replace the default one (`prompts/cli.md`). Create a markdown file in the `~/.vibe/prompts/` directory with your custom prompt content.

To use a custom system prompt, set the `system_prompt_id` in your configuration to match the filename (without the `.md` extension):

```toml
# Use a custom system prompt
system_prompt_id = "my_custom_prompt"
```

This will load the prompt from `~/.vibe/prompts/my_custom_prompt.md`.

Project-local prompts in `.vibe/prompts/` are also supported and override user-level prompts with the same name. This applies to all custom prompts (system and compaction).

### Custom Compaction Prompts

Compaction uses the built-in prompt at `prompts/compact.md` by default. You can replace it with a custom prompt from `~/.vibe/prompts/` (or `.vibe/prompts/`) using the same resolution rules as system prompts.

To use a custom compaction prompt, set `compaction_prompt_id` in your configuration to match the filename (without the `.md` extension):

```toml
# Use a custom compaction prompt
compaction_prompt_id = "my_compaction_prompt"
```

Any extra instructions passed to `/compact ...` are appended after the configured compaction prompt.

### Custom Agent Configurations

You can create custom agent configurations for specific use cases (e.g., red-teaming, specialized tasks) by adding agent-specific TOML files in the `~/.vibe/agents/` directory.

To use a custom agent, run Vibe with the `--agent` flag:

```bash
vibe --agent my_custom_agent
```

Vibe will look for a file named `my_custom_agent.toml` in the agents directory and apply its configuration.

Example custom agent configuration (`~/.vibe/agents/redteam.toml`):

```toml
# Custom agent configuration for red-teaming
active_model = "mistral-medium-3.5"
system_prompt_id = "redteam"

# Disable some tools for this agent
disabled_tools = ["search_replace", "write_file"]

# Override tool permissions for this agent
[tools.bash]
permission = "always"

[tools.read_file]
permission = "always"
```

Note: This implies that you have set up a redteam prompt named `~/.vibe/prompts/redteam.md`.

### Tool Management

#### Enable/Disable Tools with Patterns

You can control which tools are active using `enabled_tools` and `disabled_tools`.
These fields support exact names, glob patterns, and regular expressions.

Examples:

```toml
# Only enable tools that start with "serena_" (glob)
enabled_tools = ["serena_*"]

# Regex (prefix with re:) — matches full tool name (case-insensitive)
enabled_tools = ["re:^serena_.*$"]

# Disable a group with glob; everything else stays enabled
disabled_tools = ["mcp_*", "grep"]
```

Notes:

- MCP tool names use underscores, e.g., `serena_list` not `serena.list`.
- Regex patterns are matched against the full tool name using fullmatch.

### MCP Server Configuration

You can configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend Vibe's capabilities. Add MCP server configurations under the `mcp_servers` section:

```toml
# Example MCP server configurations
[[mcp_servers]]
name = "my_http_server"
transport = "http"
url = "http://localhost:8000"
headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer my_token" }
api_key_env = "MY_API_KEY_ENV_VAR"
api_key_header = "Authorization"
api_key_format = "Bearer {token}"

[[mcp_servers]]
name = "my_streamable_server"
transport = "streamable-http"
url = "http://localhost:8001"
headers = { "X-API-Key" = "my_api_key" }

[[mcp_servers]]
name = "fetch_server"
transport = "stdio"
command = "uvx"
args = ["mcp-server-fetch"]
env = { "DEBUG" = "1", "LOG_LEVEL" = "info" }
```

Supported transports:

- `http`: Standard HTTP transport
- `streamable-http`: HTTP transport with streaming support
- `stdio`: Standard input/output transport (for local processes)

Key fields:

- `name`: A short alias for the server (used in tool names)
- `transport`: The transport type
- `url`: Base URL for HTTP transports
- `headers`: Additional HTTP headers
- `api_key_env`: Environment variable containing the API key
- `command`: Command to run for stdio transport
- `args`: Additional arguments for stdio transport
- `startup_timeout_sec`: Timeout in seconds for the server to start and initialize (default 10s)
- `tool_timeout_sec`: Timeout in seconds for tool execution (default 60s)
- `env`: Environment variables to set for the MCP server of transport type stdio

MCP tools are named using the pattern `{server_name}_{tool_name}` and can be configured with permissions like built-in tools:

```toml
# Configure permissions for specific MCP tools
[tools.fetch_server_get]
permission = "always"

[tools.my_http_server_query]
permission = "ask"
```

MCP server configurations support additional features:

- **Environment variables**: Set environment variables for MCP servers
- **Custom timeouts**: Configure startup and tool execution timeouts

Example with environment variables and timeouts:

```toml
[[mcp_servers]]
name = "my_server"
transport = "http"
url = "http://localhost:8000"
env = { "DEBUG" = "1", "LOG_LEVEL" = "info" }
startup_timeout_sec = 15
tool_timeout_sec = 120
```

### Session Management

#### Session Continuation and Resumption

Vibe supports continuing from previous sessions:

- **`--continue`** or **`-c`**: Continue from the most recent saved session
- **`--resume SESSION_ID`**: Resume a specific session by ID (supports partial matching)

```bash
# Continue from last session
vibe --continue

# Resume specific session
vibe --resume abc123
```

Session logging must be enabled in your configuration for these features to work.

#### Working Directory Control

Use the `--workdir` option to specify a working directory:

```bash
vibe --workdir /path/to/project
```

This is useful when you want to run Vibe from a different location than your current directory.

Use `--add-dir` (repeatable) to make additional directories available to the agent for the duration of the session:

```bash
vibe --add-dir /path/to/other-project --add-dir /path/to/library
```

Each path is implicitly trusted (no trust prompt) and contributes its `AGENTS.md` and `.vibe/` configuration (tools, skills, agents, prompts, hooks) to the session. File-tool permissions treat each `--add-dir` path the same way as your primary working directory — reads and writes inside them don't require the "outside workdir" prompt. Nested paths collapse: passing `/repo` and `/repo/sub` is equivalent to passing just `/repo`.

### Update Settings

#### Auto-Update

Vibe includes an automatic update feature that keeps your installation current. This is enabled by default.

To disable auto-updates, add this to your `config.toml`:

```toml
enable_auto_update = false
```

### Notification Settings

Vibe can notify you when the agent needs your attention (awaiting approval, asking a question, or task complete). This is useful when you switch to another window while the agent works.

To disable notifications:

```toml
enable_notifications = false
```

### Custom Vibe Home Directory

By default, Vibe stores its configuration in `~/.vibe/`. You can override this by setting the `VIBE_HOME` environment variable:

```bash
export VIBE_HOME="/path/to/custom/vibe/home"
```

This affects where Vibe looks for:

- `config.toml` - Main configuration
- `.env` - API keys
- `agents/` - Custom agent configurations
- `prompts/` - Custom system and compaction prompts
- `tools/` - Custom tools
- `logs/` - Session logs

## Editors/IDEs

Mistral Vibe can be used in text editors and IDEs that support [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/clients). See the [ACP Setup documentation](docs/acp-setup.md) for setup instructions for various editors and IDEs.
