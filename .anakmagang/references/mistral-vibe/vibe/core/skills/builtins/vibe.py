You are running inside **Mistral Vibe**, a CLI coding agent built by Mistral AI.
This skill gives you full knowledge of the application internals so you can help
the user understand, configure, and troubleshoot their Vibe installation.

## VIBE_HOME

The user's Vibe home directory defaults to `~/.vibe` but can be overridden via
the `VIBE_HOME` environment variable. All user-level configuration, skills, tools,
agents, prompts, logs, and session data live here.

### Directory Structure

```
~/.vibe/
  config.toml          # Main configuration file (TOML format)
  hooks.toml           # User-level hook definitions (experimental)
  .env                 # API keys and credentials (dotenv format)
  vibehistory          # Command history
  trusted_folders.toml # Trust database for project folders
  agents/              # Custom agent profiles (*.toml)
  prompts/             # Custom prompts (*.md)
  skills/              # User-level skills (each skill is a subdirectory with SKILL.md)
  tools/               # Custom tool definitions
  logs/
    vibe.log           # Main log file
    session/           # Session log files
  plans/               # Session plans

~/.agents/
  skills/              # Additional user-level skills directory
```

### Project-Local Configuration

When in a trusted folder, Vibe also looks for project-local configuration:
- `.vibe/config.toml` - Project-specific config (overrides user config)
- `.vibe/hooks.toml` - Project-specific hooks (requires trusted folder)
- `.vibe/skills/` - Project-specific skills
- `.vibe/tools/` - Project-specific tools
- `.vibe/agents/` - Project-specific agents
- `.vibe/prompts/` - Project-specific prompts
- `.agents/skills/` - Standard agent skills directory

## Configuration (config.toml)

The configuration file uses TOML format. Settings can also be overridden via
environment variables with the `VIBE_` prefix (e.g., `VIBE_ACTIVE_MODEL=local`).

Custom prompt IDs are resolved from project-local `.vibe/prompts/` first, then
from `~/.vibe/prompts/`, and finally from the built-in bundled prompts.

### Key Settings

```toml
# Model selection
active_model = "mistral-medium-3.5"  # Model alias to use (see [[models]])

# UI preferences
vim_keybindings = false
disable_welcome_banner_animation = false
autocopy_to_clipboard = true
file_watcher_for_autocomplete = false

# Behavior
bypass_tool_permissions = false    # Skip tool approval prompts
system_prompt_id = "cli"          # System prompt: "cli", "lean", or custom .md filename
compaction_prompt_id = "compact"  # Compaction prompt: built-in "compact" or custom .md filename
enable_telemetry = true
enable_update_checks = true
enable_auto_update = true
enable_notifications = true
enable_system_trust_store = false  # Use OS trust store for outbound HTTPS
api_timeout = 720.0               # API request timeout in seconds
auto_compact_threshold = 200000   # Token count before auto-compaction

# Git commit behavior
include_commit_signature = true   # Add "Co-Authored-By" to commits

# System prompt composition
include_model_info = true         # Include model name in system prompt
include_project_context = true    # Include project context (git info, cwd) in system prompt
include_prompt_detail = true      # Include OS info, tool prompts, skills, and agents in system prompt

# Voice features
voice_mode_enabled = false
narrator_enabled = false
active_transcribe_model = "voxtral-realtime"
active_tts_model = "voxtral-tts"
```

### Providers

```toml
[[providers]]
name = "mistral"
api_base = "https://api.mistral.ai/v1"
api_key_env_var = "MISTRAL_API_KEY"
backend = "mistral"

[[providers]]
name = "llamacpp"
api_base = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"
api_key_env_var = ""
extra_headers = { "X-Custom-Header" = "value" }  # optional per-provider HTTP headers
```

### Models

```toml
[[models]]
name = "mistral-vibe-cli-latest"
provider = "mistral"
alias = "mistral-medium-3.5"
temperature = 1.0
input_price = 1.5
output_price = 7.5
thinking = "high"                 # "off", "low", "medium", "high", "max"
auto_compact_threshold = 200000

[[models]]
name = "devstral-small-latest"
provider = "mistral"
alias = "devstral-small"
input_price = 0.1
output_price = 0.3

[[models]]
name = "devstral"
provider = "llamacpp"
alias = "local"
```

### Tool Configuration

```toml
# Additional tool search paths
tool_paths = ["/path/to/custom/tools"]

# Enable only specific tools (glob and regex supported)
enabled_tools = ["bash", "read_file", "grep"]

# Disable specific tools
disabled_tools = ["webfetch"]

# Per-tool configuration
[tools.bash]
allowlist = ["git", "npm", "python"]
```

**Special case — `find` command:** Even if `find` is in the bash allowlist,
Vibe detects `-exec`, `-execdir`, `-ok`, and `-okdir` predicates and will
prompt for user permission before running the command.

#### File Tool Permission Resolution

File-based tools (`read_file`, `grep`, `write_file`, `search_replace`) resolve
permissions in this order (first match wins):

1. **Scratchpad** path → always allowed
2. **denylist** glob match → always denied
3. **allowlist** glob match → always allowed
4. **sensitive_patterns** match → requires approval
5. **Outside workdir** → requires approval (or denied if `permission = "never"`)
6. **Default** → uses the tool's `permission` setting

The **denylist** is checked before the allowlist — a path matching both lists
is denied. Both are checked before the outside-workdir boundary, so the
allowlist can still auto-approve access to directories outside the project.

### Skill Configuration

```toml
# Additional skill search paths
skill_paths = ["/path/to/custom/skills"]

# Enable only specific skills
enabled_skills = ["vibe", "custom-*"]

# Disable specific skills
disabled_skills = ["experimental-*"]
```

### Agent Configuration

```toml
# Additional agent search paths
agent_paths = ["/path/to/custom/agents"]

# Enable/disable agents
enabled_agents = ["default", "plan"]
disabled_agents = ["auto-approve"]

# Opt-in builtin agents (only affects agents with install_required=True, e.g. lean)
installed_agents = ["lean"]

# Agent profile to use when --agent is not passed in interactive mode
# (default: "default"). Valid values: "default", "plan", "accept-edits",
# "auto-approve", "lean" (only when listed in installed_agents), or any
# custom agent name from ~/.vibe/agents/ or .vibe/agents/. Subagents
# (e.g. "explore") are rejected. Ignored in programmatic mode
# (-p/--prompt), which falls back to "auto-approve" when --agent is not
# provided.
default_agent = "plan"
```

### MCP Servers

```toml
[[mcp_servers]]
name = "my-server"
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@my/mcp-server"]

[[mcp_servers]]
name = "remote-server"
transport = "http"
url = "https://mcp.example.com"
api_key_env = "MCP_API_KEY"
```

### Connectors

Mistral connectors are auto-discovered when the active provider is Mistral
and the API key env var is set. Toggle the master switch or hide individual
connectors / tools:

```toml
enable_connectors = true          # Master switch (default: true)

[[connectors]]
name = "github"
disabled = true                   # Hide all tools from this connector

[[connectors]]
name = "linear"
disabled_tools = ["delete_issue"] # Hide selected tools only
```

### Session Logging

```toml
[session_logging]
enabled = true
save_dir = ""                     # Defaults to ~/.vibe/logs/session
session_prefix = "session"
```

### Browser Sign-In

Browser sign-in lets users authenticate through the browser during onboarding.
Mistral providers use default browser sign-in URLs. Custom or renamed providers
must configure both URLs:

```toml
[[providers]]
browser_auth_base_url = "https://console.mistral.ai"
browser_auth_api_base_url = "https://console.mistral.ai/api"
```

Self-hosted deployments can point Vibe CLI upgrade and API-key links to their
Le Chat web deployment, where the Vibe API key is managed:

```toml
vibe_base_url = "https://chat.mistral.ai"
```

### Hooks (Experimental)

Hooks let users run shell commands automatically at specific points during a
session. The feature is **experimental** and must be enabled first:

```toml
# In config.toml
enable_experimental_hooks = true
```

Or via the environment variable `VIBE_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_HOOKS=true`.

#### Hook Configuration Files

Hooks are defined in `hooks.toml` files (separate from `config.toml`):

1. **User-level**: `~/.vibe/hooks.toml` (always loaded when hooks are enabled)
2. **Project-level**: `<project>/.vibe/hooks.toml` (only loaded if the folder is trusted)

Both files are merged; if a hook name appears in both, the first one wins and
a warning is shown for the duplicate.

#### hooks.toml Format

```toml
[[hooks]]
name = "lint"                     # Unique hook name (required)
type = "post_agent_turn"          # Hook type (required, see below)
command = "eslint --quiet ."      # Shell command to execute (required)
timeout = 30.0                    # Seconds before the hook is killed (default: 30)
description = "Run ESLint"        # Optional human-readable description

[[hooks]]
name = "typecheck"
type = "post_agent_turn"
command = "npx tsc --noEmit"
timeout = 60.0
description = "Run TypeScript type checking"
```

#### Available Hook Types

| Type | When it runs |
|---|---|
| `post_agent_turn` | After the agent finishes a turn (no more pending tool calls) |

#### How Hooks Execute

- Each hook runs as a **shell subprocess** in the current working directory.
- The hook receives a **JSON object on stdin** with context:
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "...",
    "transcript_path": "/path/to/session/log.jsonl",
    "cwd": "/current/working/dir",
    "hook_event_name": "post_agent_turn"
  }
  ```
- If the hook exceeds its `timeout`, the entire process tree is killed.

#### Exit Code Semantics

| Exit Code | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success — hook output is shown as an info message |
| `2` | **Retry** — hook's stdout is injected as a new user message, and the agent gets another turn to fix the issue (max 3 retries per hook in a row per user message) |
| Any other | Warning — hook output is shown as a warning message |

The retry mechanism (exit code 2) is powerful: the hook can tell the agent what
went wrong, and the agent will attempt to fix it automatically. For example, a
linter hook can output the lint errors, and the agent will try to resolve them.

#### Example: Post-Turn Linting Hook

```toml
# .vibe/hooks.toml
[[hooks]]
name = "ruff-check"
type = "post_agent_turn"
command = "uv run ruff check --quiet ."
timeout = 30.0
description = "Check for lint errors after each turn"
```

If the linter finds issues and exits with code 2, its stdout (the error
messages) is fed back to the agent as a user message, prompting the agent to
fix the problems. After 3 failed retries the hook stops retrying.

### Pattern Matching

Tool, skill, and agent names support three matching modes:
- **Exact**: `"bash"`, `"read_file"`
- **Glob**: `"bash*"`, `"mcp_*"`
- **Regex**: `"re:^serena_.*$"` (full match, case-insensitive)

```

## Built-in Agents

There are two kinds of agents:
- **Agents** are user-facing profiles selectable via `--agent` or `Shift+Tab`.
  They configure the model's behavior, tools, and system prompt.
- **Subagents** are model-facing: the model can spawn them autonomously to delegate
  subtasks (e.g. exploring the codebase). Users cannot select subagents directly.

### Agents

- **default**: Standard interactive agent
- **plan**: Planning-focused agent
- **accept-edits**: Auto-approves file edits but asks for other tools
- **auto-approve**: Auto-approves all tool calls
- **lean**: Specialized Lean 4 proof assistant. Not available by default — must be
  installed with `/leanstall` (removed with `/unleanstall`)

### Subagents

- **explore**: Read-only codebase exploration subagent (grep + read_file only).
  Spawned by the model, not selectable by the user.

Custom agents are TOML files in `~/.vibe/agents/NAME.toml`.

- `/config` - Edit config settings
- `/model` - Select active model
- `/thinking` - Select thinking level
- `/theme` - Select Textual UI theme (persisted in config)
- `/reload` - Reload configuration, agent instructions, and skills from disk

## Skills System

Skills are specialized instruction sets the model can load on demand.
Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter.

### Skill File Format

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it.
user-invocable: true
allowed-tools: bash read_file
---

# Skill Instructions

Detailed instructions for the model...
```

### Skill Search Order (first match wins)

1. `skill_paths` from config.toml
2. `.vibe/skills/` in trusted project directory
3. `.agents/skills/` in trusted project directory
4. `~/.vibe/skills/` (user global)
5. `~/.agents/skills/` (user global, Agent Skills standard)

## Environment Variables

- `VIBE_HOME` - Override the Vibe home directory (default: `~/.vibe`)
- `MISTRAL_API_KEY` - API key for Mistral provider
- `VIBE_ACTIVE_MODEL` - Override active model
- `VIBE_*` - Any config field can be overridden with the `VIBE_` prefix
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level for `$VIBE_HOME/logs/vibe.log`. One of `DEBUG`,
  `INFO`, `WARNING` (default), `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. Invalid values fall back
  to `WARNING`.
- `LOG_MAX_BYTES` - Max size in bytes of `vibe.log` before rotation
  (default: `10485760`, i.e. 10 MiB).
- `DEBUG_MODE` - When `true`, forces `DEBUG`-level logging. Under `vibe-acp`
  it also attaches `debugpy` on `localhost:5678`.
- `VIBE_TYPING_GRACE_PERIOD_MS` - Milliseconds the agent waits for a typing
  pause before showing tool-approval / ask-user-question dialogs (default:
  `1000`). Set to `0` to disable. Negative or non-numeric values fall back
  to the default.

## API Keys (.env file)

The `.env` file in VIBE_HOME stores API keys in dotenv format:

```
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

This file is loaded on startup and its values are injected into the environment.

## Trusted Folders

Vibe uses a trust system to prevent executing project-local config from untrusted
directories. The trust database is stored in `~/.vibe/trusted_folders.toml`.
Project-local config (`.vibe/` directory) is only loaded when the current
directory is explicitly trusted.

Interactive mode prompts to trust unknown folders. Programmatic mode
(`-p`/`--prompt`) never prompts: the folder is untrusted. Use `--trust` to
trust cwd for the current invocation only (not persisted).

## Sensitive Files — DO NOT READ OR EDIT

NEVER read, display, or edit any of these files:
- `~/.vibe/.env` (or `$VIBE_HOME/.env`) — contains API keys and secrets
- Any `.env`, `.env.*` file in the project or VIBE_HOME

If the user asks to set or change an API key, instruct them to edit the `.env`
file themselves. Do not offer to read it, write it, or display its contents.
Do not use tools (read_file, write_file, bash cat/echo, etc.) to access these files.

## How to Modify Configuration

To help the user modify their Vibe configuration:

1. **Read current config**: Read the file at `~/.vibe/config.toml` (or the path
   from `VIBE_HOME` env var if set)
2. **Create a backup**: Before any edit, copy the file to `config.toml.bak` in the
   same directory (e.g. `cp ~/.vibe/config.toml ~/.vibe/config.toml.bak`). This
   applies to any config file you are about to modify (`config.toml`,
   `trusted_folders.toml`, agent TOML files, etc.)
3. **Edit the TOML file**: Make changes using the search_replace or write_file tool
4. **Reload**: The user can run `/reload` to apply changes without restarting

For API keys, tell the user to edit `~/.vibe/.env` directly — never read or
write that file yourself.

For project-specific configuration, create/edit `.vibe/config.toml` in the
project root (the folder must be trusted first).""",
