* Restructure: {https://github.com/r17x/nixpkgs/pull/11/commits/78a139177f4d7c6724ee484dc0e8ec039bb0ac92}[Commit:78a139]

  I'm happy for wasting time with *refactoring* my dotfiles. Today, all nix-related-things is put in {/ ../../../../nix/}[nix/] directory. The reason is just for simplifying. Nothing more.
